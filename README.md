# Visualization-and-Clustering-I

This repository have only one file that contains two different cases. 
The beginning of the code is about query and visualization, the end of it is about clustering. 
It was made using Google Colab and with Phyton.

The case for query and visualization was called DezzDryth Online, it was an online game.
The objective of this case was to make some analysis from the given data and visualize it
into chart and diagram.

The case for clustering was called Grizzer, it was a wild animal hunting organization.
The case asked me to make clustering model for grizzly bear cluster and non-grizzly bear cluster.
Then it asked to be visualized using pyplot package annd checked the model to predict
whether the dta will be grizzly bear cluster and non-grizzly bear cluster. The minimum accuracy, 
it's asked was 80% or higher.

Note: <br>
The Beartraining.csv had weight, front claws, pupillary distance, ear shape, and length column.
The BearTesting.csv had weight, front claws, pupillary distance, ear shape, length, and grizzly column.
